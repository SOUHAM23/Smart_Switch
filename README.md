# 💡 Smart Bulb Controller

An Arduino-based project to control a smart bulb using a microcontroller.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Control the smart bulb's state (on/off) via microcontroller inputs.
* Simple and efficient code written in C++.
* Designed for easy integration with home automation systems.

---

## 🧰 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Arduino IDE installed on your computer.
* An Arduino-compatible microcontroller (e.g., Arduino Uno).
* A smart bulb compatible with microcontroller control.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/duttasunanda/Smart_Bulb.git
   ```



2. Open `smart_bulbe.ino` in the Arduino IDE.
3. Connect your microcontroller to your computer via USB.
4. Upload the sketch to your microcontroller.
